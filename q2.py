#2. (20 points) Write a Python function `graphSnowfall(t)` which retrives data in a text file _t_ and displays that information in a bar chart.

#I used numpy because i feel that it is the best and most efficient way of arranging it in ranges and then I used matplot lib to arrange it into a bar from a histogram 

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def graphSnowfall(t):
    # Read the data from the text file into a NumPy array
    snowfall_data = np.loadtxt(t)  # Assuming the data is in a simple text file format

    # Define the ranges for snowfall aggregation
    ranges = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

    # Aggregate the snowfall values into the specified ranges
    #snowfall_aggregate to store the histogram values, and the underscore _ is used to discard the bin edges, as they are not needed for the bar chart.
    snowfall_aggregate, _ = np.histogram(snowfall_data, bins=ranges)

    # Plot the snowfall data as a bar chart
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Adjust the figure size as needed
    plt.bar([f"{ranges[i]}-{ranges[i+1]} cm" for i in range(len(ranges)-1)], snowfall_aggregate)
    plt.xlabel('Snowfall Range')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title('Snowfall Data')
    plt.show()
    plt.savefig('snow.png')
